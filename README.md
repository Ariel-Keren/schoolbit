Think Google Classroom but specifically designed for programming classes (computer science, software engineering and more).<br>
SchoolBit allows teachers to create digital classrooms for their students, where they can post assignments, which the students can do.<br>
With a built-in code editor, it is easier than ever to write code quickly and efficiently directly in the browser.<br>
Using this method of writing code in the browser and not sending files (which takes the student a lot of time) allows for an easier life for the teacher, who now does not have to download each and every file every student of his/hers sends to him/her.<br>
This makes it much easier for the teacher to grade the assignment for every student, which he/she is able to send to each student.<br>
A student's grades will appear in his/her grades page after they have been sent by the teacher.<br>
While grading a student's work, the teacher can comment on each and every line of code.<br>
The comments are sent with the grade back to the student, shown with the original code which the student has written.<br>
